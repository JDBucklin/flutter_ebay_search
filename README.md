# flutter_ebay_search
A basic Flutter/Dart app that searches eBay using the eBay sandbox API.

In order to run the application you will need to add a file called credentials.json to the /lib/assets/ directory. It should be formatted as follows:
```json
{
	"AppID": "<AppID>",
	"CertID": "<CertID>"
}
```
Both the `<AppID>` and `<CertID>` can be obtained by registering in the eBay developers program here: [https://developer.ebay.com/](https://developer.ebay.com/) and creating application access keys.
